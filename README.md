Hello guy, 

This is a basic linux driver repo including character driver and platform
driver. Create the simple and overall linux driver for beginer.

# How-to-use
Each folder will contain the specific source code file .c and Makefile. 
First, this driver has been running in Raspberry Pi target, so this I use
cross-compile in the Makefile config. You can edit the Makefile to adapt with
your compiler you want to used. 

For cross-compiler, referent to this book: https://github.com/ALIBERA/linux_book_2nd_edition
